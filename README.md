Task 1 ID (Learning Github resource &amp; Pycharm resource)
Task 1 of Industrial Design 2020, learning to use Github.
I am following the "Hello World" Github tutorial (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). This is teaching me how to creates repositories and branches of my work. Github will be where I store all my ID class work for the year so learning the basics of its resource is key to the whole year.
